## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I wrote the code with semantic HTML5 elements. I used materializecss for styling in addition to custom CSS stylesheet. The nucleotide conversion is done with client-side JavaScript. I organised the codes into four seperate functions to handle each conversion request.  

## Optimizations

In the JavaScript file, I organised the codes into four seperate functions to handle each conversion request. I would like to use object oriented programming approach.

## Lessons Learned:

I learnt to seperate the functions into blocks for better developer experience. It makes it easier to make changes and maintain the code.
